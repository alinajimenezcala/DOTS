This project strives to find an optimal winning strategy for a kids and adult-favorite game - Dots.
This project serves as a starting approach to building a helper method for the game using Monte Carlo 
Tree Search and Neural Networks to make traversing the game space less computationally intensive and
designing a possible efficient way to visualize the game.
